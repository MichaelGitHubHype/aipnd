# Image classifier application 


## Project parts:

* Notebook: The notebook is the first part of the project. It shows the training, validation and testing process of the data in a Jupyter notebook followed by examples of the images being actually plotted on a bar chart along with their top classes. 

* train.py: The train python file is basically the first part of the jupyter notebook with the addition of command line arguments the user can enter to modify the process. In this part, a network is being created, trained and saved. 

* predict.py: The predict python file is the second part of the project. In this part it is already assumed a checkpoint is created along with a file of labels and using this files the top classes are displayed. 




## Sample output:

* train.py:
training 4 epoch checkpoint, 512 hidden units: https://prnt.sc/kkk78s

* notebook:

* predict.py:
